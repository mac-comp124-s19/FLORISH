# This app is meant to provide a platform for healthy drinking. A user will input each time they consume a drink and a graphic (of a creature, such as a plant) will reflect this relative health, appearing more sickly in correlation with more drinks. Ideally, there will also be an input for water consumption. When this is input, the plant will get healthier. This is in progress and will be updated continuosly.
